# Lab 8

I completed Lab 8 by experimenting with jQuery and completing all the tasks in the PowerPoint.

## Task 2 Questions
1. What is the behaviour of the script?
> When any div is clicked, it will be queried for its colour. If it is red, it will become blue. If it is blue, it will become green. If it is green, it will become red.

2. Which elements are selected?
> All div elements.

3. What does $(this) refer to?
> The element that is currently being clicked.

4. Find the doucumentation for the `hasClass` function using the search tool on https://api.jquery.com/
> https://api.jquery.com/hasClass/#hasClass-className

5. Find a function in https://api.jquery.com/category/css that could simplify the if ... else block. Could be easy with two, slightly harder with three.
